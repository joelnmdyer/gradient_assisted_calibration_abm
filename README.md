# gradient_assisted_calibration_abm
Code for paper "Gradient-assisted calibration for financial agent-based models", 
which appeared in the Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on AI in Finance. In this paper, we consider how agent-based models can be constructed in a differentiable manner, and how the differentiability of a differentiable agent
-based model might be useful for accelerating _generalised_ Bayesian parameter inference procedures. See the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ria0aKWztGE">INET Oxford YouTube Channel for a recording of a talk</a> I gave about this paper.
